# Template-Engine

In this script, I used node.js to generate an HTML file that would populate a team of programmers. To do this, a few modules were used including inquirer, path and render. 


In this simple script, the user would be prompted on the manager they would like to create for their team. After the manager has been created, the user is prompted to create more  program will loop so that the user has the ability to add as many engineers or interns as they please. The manager, engineer and intern are all extended from my base class of Employee, which holds the base properties of name, id, email. 

After the user has generated their team, they are to select the "none" on the add employees. This will exit the loop and then and promptly export the information that the user has both input and selected and this is rendered to an pre-formatted HTML file in our output directory. 

 Below is a video on how this program works:
